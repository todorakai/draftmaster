# Draft Master - Project Pitch 🎮

## The Problem

League of Legends is one of the most popular esports in the world, with millions of players competing daily. The draft phase—where teams select and ban champions—is **critical to winning**, yet most players struggle with:

- **Information overload**: 160+ champions with complex interactions
- **Limited strategic knowledge**: Understanding team compositions and synergies
- **Time pressure**: Making optimal decisions in 30-second windows
- **Lack of data**: No easy access to professional team strategies and statistics
- **Inconsistent performance**: Difficulty adapting to opponent picks

**The result?** Games are often lost before they even begin, in the draft phase.
